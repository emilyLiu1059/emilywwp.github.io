## Project for West Windsor Park 

https://emilyliu1059.github.io/wwp-parks/

Led Girlscout team members to visit each park. Took picture of the park and facilities. Prepare web content and presentation for each park. 

The the initial work that I created for 12 parks for West Windsor Township is located on https://emilywwp.github.io/. For some reason, cannot access it anymore.  I replicated to this repository.

**Challenge:** The page load was terribly slow. It turned out the picture we took was too large with iPhone. Use GIMP to reduce the size of the image.
