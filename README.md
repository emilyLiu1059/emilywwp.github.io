## Project for West Windsor Park 

Led Girlscout team members to go to each park to look at the facility and take pictures. Prepare web content and presentation for each park. 

The the initial work that I created for 12 parks for West Windsor Township is located on https://emilywwp.github.io/

**Challenge:** The page load was terribly slow. It turned out the picture we took was too large with iPhone. Use GIMP to reduce the size of the image.
