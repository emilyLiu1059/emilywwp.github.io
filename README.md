## Project for West Windsor Park 
The the initial work that I created for 12 parks in West Windsor Township is located on https://emilywwp.github.io/

Led team members to go to the each park look at the facility and take pictures. Prepare web content and presentation for each park. 
Challenge: The page load was terribly slow. It turned out the picture we took was too large. Use GIMP to reduce the size of the image.
